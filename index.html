            <h1>Early days... (April 21, 2015)</h1>
            <p> I've always had a facination with being "online". I remember logging into my first ever
                <span class="blog_view_toggle" data-id="runescape2-2004">MMORPG[Runescape2]</span> for the
                first time back in 2004. I was maybe 12 years old and had no idea what I was in for. Before I realized
                it, I was talking to people and making friends. I was excited to login, and continue these relationships with
                people all over the world that I would probably never meet otherwise. We shared common goals, and that
                was awesome!
            </p>

            <p>
                MMORPG's are social games at the core, and thats what makes them special. It seems finally developers are starting
                to figure this out.
            </p>

            <p>
                This game is a project that will be unlike any other MMORPG out there. There are so many elements to modern
                AAA MMORPG'S that make them so bad that I cant believe people poured millions of dollars into the project,
                and thought "Hey, this is fun!". Social is fun, lets do cool things with other people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every game is copying eachother, and they arent focusing on the bigger picture. Games are
                for fun; are you having fun? This game will not be pouring millions of dollars into graphics, but my goal
                is to make sure you are having fun.
            </p>

            <p>
                MMORPG's are hard; I'll be honest, There will be lots of bugs, lots of new features, and LOTS of fun.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm writing these developer blogs monthly, in hopes that people like you and me come across it  and get
                behind the idea. An online game, where its not about swords and lore, but about the experience possible.

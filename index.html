            <h1>Early days... (April 21, 2015)</h1>
            <p> I've always had a fascination with being "online". I still remember logging into my first ever MMORPG.

                <span class="blog_view_toggle" data-id="runescape2-2004">Runescape2</span>

                For the first time back in 2004. I was maybe 12 years old and had no idea what I was in for. Before I realized
                it, I was talking to people and making friends. I was excited to be a part of something, and continue these
                relationships with people all over the world that I would probably never meet otherwise. We shared common
                goals, and that was awesome!
            </p>

            <p>
                MMORPG's are social games at the core, and that's what makes them special. It seems finally developers are starting
                to figure this out.
            </p>

            <p>
                This game is a project that will be unlike any other mmo out there. There are so many bad design decisions
                in modern games that make them not fun to play. Social is fun, lets do cool things with other people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Online gaming has hit a standstill, and they aren't focusing on the bigger picture. Games are
                for fun; are you having fun? This game will not be pouring millions of dollars into graphics, but my goal
                is to make sure you are having fun with lots of other people.
            </p>

            <p>
                MMORPG's are hard. I'll be honest, there will be lots of bugs and features, but also a ton of fun.
                I'm keeping the servers up 24/7 so you can just pop in and see how the game is progressing. Patch notes
                are written weekly, and server updates (now and the near future) can happen at any moment.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm writing these developer blogs monthly, in hopes that people like you and me come across it  and get
                behind the idea. An online game, where its not about swords and lore, but about the best experience possible.
            </p>

                Come hang out.
